/// A [`Route`] that forwards its requests to a tower service.
///
/// This adapter mounts a whole tower application (an axum router, a hyper
/// service, a reverse proxy) as a route in a topcoat router, typically while
/// migrating an existing application to topcoat one route at a time.
/// Registered at a catch-all path with [`Methods::Any`], it hands an entire
/// URL subtree to the service. The service receives each request with its
/// original URI; nothing is stripped or rewritten. A catch-all segment does
/// not match the bare prefix itself, so register a second `TowerRoute` for
/// the prefix if the service also serves that URL.
///
/// The service must be `Clone`, `Send`, and `Sync`; wrap a service that is
/// not `Sync` in `tower::buffer`. Its per-request clones share cross-request
/// state through the service's internal handles.
///
/// An error the mounted service returns surfaces as an [`Error`] wrapping a
/// [`TowerServiceError`]; unmapped, the router renders it as a 500. Layers
/// wrapping the route's path apply as they would to any other route.
